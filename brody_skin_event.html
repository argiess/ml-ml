		<h2>AP Bren Has Officially Chosen Brody For The M5 Champion Skin</h2>

		<p>M5 World Champions AP Bren has officially confirmed Brody as their chosen hero to co-design with international gaming developer and publisher MOONTON Games. The team was given the chance to work with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang maker as part of the perks for winning the world's biggest MLBB tournament hosted in the Philippines last December 2023. Â  

			"We feel that Brody has been a big part of our success in the M5 series. This hero has helped our team consistently and ultimately helped retain the PH era of MLBB. We want this hero to represent our team's success inside the game and for our fans to be part of that success by owning the skin and enjoying it," says Jab Escutin, AP Bren Director.
			
			Additionally, MOONTON Games will give David "FlapTzy" Canon an opportunity to co-design Paquito's #M5FMVPSkin, as the M5 World Championship's Finals MVP. Paquito is an MLBB hero inspired by Manny Pacquiao, one of the world's greatest professional boxers of all time.
